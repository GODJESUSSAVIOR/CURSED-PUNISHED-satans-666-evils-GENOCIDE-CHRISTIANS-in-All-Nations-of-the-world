India Manipur Christian Leader Pleads for Help

Persecution.org News By J. M. Lindner 

12 June 2023 India ( International Christian Concern ) ~ A Christian leader in Manipur, a state in northeast India, is pleading for help because of the murder, desecration, and disruption of his people by a warring tribe. 

The leader, a native of Manipur who remains unnamed for security reasons, said that members of the Meitei tribe “are killing innocent women, children, pastors, and even civil servants” among the Kuki and Zo tribes.  

Not only has the government done nothing to stop the violence, but the government has also even sided with the rampaging Hindu tribals. He writes, “the State Chief Ministry, N. Biren Singh, and MP Sapam, a member of Parliament, are heading the Meitei Leepun and Aramba Tenggol,” while the State Police and the Meitei Army join forces to “rape, kill, and burn the minoritiy Kukies. The Christian community is suffering from ethnic cleansing and genocide.” 

“Churches and Villages are burned down by these Meitei Hindus along with Manipur State Police and even India Army, which are led by Meitei officer [who] join hand with them to kill and burn,” the Manipur Christian leader stated. 

Thus far he said the conflict has killed at least 147 Christians, and injured another 220, with an additional 58 persons lost or not accounted for. He said 170 villages have been burned, affecting 17 churches his organization has planted, and devastating 4,581 houses and 93 Christian offices.  

In a letter dated June 6, the Zomi Students’ Federation said that 317 churches had been burned down, 100,000 people had been rendered homeless by the violence, and most of them now dwell in 147 displaced persons centers.  

The federal government, according to the Manipur leader, has done nothing. The federal government is dominated by the Bharatiya Janata Party that promotes Hindutva, a policy that promotes Hindu values above all others. “India is for Hindus” has been its slogan.  

The conflict started when the Meitei tribe sought “scheduled tribe” status with the federal government. Some 30 tribes of Manipur already have scheduled tribe status, which enables them to own land in the hills. 

The World Council of Churches said in May that if the Meiteis, who make up 50 percent of the population, gain scheduled tribe status, “the constitutional and legal protection given to the marginalized tribals of Manipur will be rendered meaningless.” The conflict began when members of the Meitei tribe attacked members of the Kuki tribe holding a peaceful protest against the proposal on May 3.  

The Manipur leader said that though his is mainly a church-planting ministry, with 52 churches planted in Manipur in the last ten years, he now is faced with conducting relief and rehabilitation. He has already begun bussing many children outside the area for schooling. 

“Your valuable prayers and generosity will help affected families and these suffering Christians in Manipur,” he stated.
